        <p>
            Drunken noodle or drunkard noodles (pad kee mao), is a Thai stir-fried noodle dish very similar to phat si-io. 
            In Thai, pad means 'to stir-fry' and khi mao means 'drunkard'.
        </p>
        <p>
            The dish is widely available in restaurants
            or at street vendors in Thailand but it is also highly popular in the United States.

        <h2>Recipe Instruction</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place rice noodles in a bowl and fill with hot water, separating the noodles with a fork or your hands; soak until softened, about 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Whisk oyster sauce, white sugar, vinegar, and lime juice together in a bowl until sauce is smooth.</li>
            <li>Pour enough oil into a wok or large skillet to coat the bottom and turn to medium-high heat. Cook and stir onion, shallot, and garlic in hot oil until fragrant and slightly softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add chicken and bell pepper; cook and stir until chicken is no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes. Move chicken mixture to 1 side of wok.</li>
            <li>Pour egg into the hot wok; cook until it becomes slightly set, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip egg and cook until set, 1 to 2 minutes more. Break egg apart with a fork and stir into chicken mixture.</li>
            <li>Mix basil and sauce into chicken mixture. Drain noodles and add to chicken mixture; cook and stir until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
