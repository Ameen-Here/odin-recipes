        <p>
            Buckwheat is a versatile, nutrient-rich plant with grain-like seeds. Buckwheat flour is made by grinding these seeds.
             It’s high in fiber and, since it is not wheat, is gluten-free.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thanks to buckwheat flour, these delicious buckwheat pancakes have a light and tender texture with a delicate, nutty flavor.

        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, egg, and melted butter.</li>
            <li>In another bowl, mix together white flour, buckwheat flour, sugar, salt and baking soda. Pour the dry ingredients into the egg-mixture. Stir until the two mixtures are just incorporated.</li>
            <li>Heat a griddle or large frying pan to medium-hot, and place 1 tablespoon of butter, margarine or oil into it. Let the butter melt before spooning the batter into the frying pan, form 4 inch pancakes out of the batter. Once bubbles form on the top of the pancakes, flip them over, and cook them on the other side for about 3 minutes. Continue with this process until all of the batter has been made into pancakes.</li>
