        <h2>Super tasty Chicken Avocado Soup! A soup that’s incredibly easy, deliciously fresh, and brimming with flavorful chicken.</h2>
        <p>
            This soup is likely to become a new favorite! It’s basically just an avocado amped up tortilla soup or something like if you turned guacamole into a soup.
        </p>
        <p>
            All of us can’t resist soups during the cold weather months but there’s just something so bright and summery about this soup. It must have something to do with the abundance of fresh flavors.
            Really it’s perfect 365 days a year. A delicious new chicken recipe and the perfect way to use up avocados.
